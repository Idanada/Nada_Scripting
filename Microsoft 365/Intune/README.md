## üí° **FAQs**

### **Q1: How do I deploy scripts to devices via Intune?**
**A1**: Go to **Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center** ‚Üí **Devices** ‚Üí **Scripts**. Upload your PowerShell or bash script, set the correct options (e.g., "Run as signed-in user"), and assign the script to the appropriate device group. [Read more here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/intune-macos-shell-scripts).

---

### **Q2: How can I check if a script successfully ran on a device?**
**A2**: After deploying a script, go to **Devices > Scripts** in the Intune Admin Center. You can track deployment success through **Reports** to see if the script was applied correctly.

---

### **Q3: Why is my compliance policy failing on macOS devices?**
**A3**: Ensure that the correct **configuration profiles** and **compliance policies** are applied. Check if the policies are up to date and if any conflicts exist between the profile settings.

---

### **Q4: Can I remotely update apps on enrolled devices?**
**A4**: Yes, Intune allows remote app management, including deployment, updates, and removal. Monitor these tasks through **Devices > Apps** in the Admin Center.

---

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue**: Script failed to run on a macOS device.
- **Solution**: Ensure the script has executable permissions. Run `chmod +x script.sh` to make it executable. Additionally, verify that the device is properly enrolled in Intune.

---

### **Issue**: Compliance policy isn't applying correctly to Windows devices.
- **Solution**: Verify that the compliance policy is correctly assigned to the device group. Also, check for conflicts between applied policies or configuration profiles.

---

### **Issue**: Linux devices aren't reporting compliance status.
- **Solution**: Ensure the Linux devices are properly enrolled and assigned the correct compliance policies. Check that the Intune connector is working correctly.
